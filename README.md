# DataAnalyticsPortFolioProjects

This Projects focuses on Data Exploration.


# Data Source:
I downloaded the data set from the Our world in data website(ourworldindata.org)
before downloading the dataset I adjust the date and include data from year 2020-2023 to get the latest data.


# Excel:
I created two separated worksheet from the dataset that I downloaded to create two tables (Covid Deaths and Covid Vaccination)
to see what data would I will be able to extract from this and then save them as excel file.


# In SQL:
I imported the two excel files in Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio to explore data that I could use for visualization.


# What I want to get from this:

How many people die from covid infection from 2020-2023?
I want to see the rate of covid infection in every country.
I want to know what would be the covid percentage for the upcoming months.
